# Coffee Roulette

## About
The intent of this project is to build and app that will automatically pair and email people once a month. This is being set up so that people in the company will be able to set aside ~30min block of time to meet some one new.

## Getting the app started
Fork this repo, and clone it down to your local machine.
Run `bundle install` to get all the necessary gems. Start the app locally with `rails s`.

## To do:

### Logic for pairing
 - Do not want to have people meet with the same person twice (ever?)
 - Do not want to pair people with some one in their own department

### Set up task to run once a month
